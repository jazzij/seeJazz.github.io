Technologies are increasingly socially embedded: they augmenting objects in our physical environment, facilitate our social interactions, and even transform the ways we process information and manage our behavior.

Ubiquitous computing systems and devices influence how we live, what we value, and how we relate to others. My research seeks to understand how diverse human values are entangled in the design and use of these technologies that shape our way of life.

Recent projects focus on collective family memory, digital memorabilia, and health and wellness. Read more about my work under Research

About Me
======
I am an Assistant Professor in Computer and Information Science at [Berea College](https://www.berea.edu/).

I received my PhD in Information Science from the [University of Michigan](http://si.umich.edu/). I was privileged to be a part of SocialWorlds group, advised by Prof. Mark Ackerman, and supported (primarily) by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, Rackham Merit Fellowship, and GEM Graduate Research Fellowship. I also was a member of the [DoIIIT Studio](http://doiiit.github.io/) and [MISC](http://misc.si.umich.edu/). After my PhD, I joined the [GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/) Research Center at the University of Minnesota. I worked with a great bunch of folks, chiefly Prof. [Lana Yarosh](http://lanayarosh.org/).

I’m also a proud graduate of [UMBC](http://umbc.edu/) and the Meyerhoff Scholars Program.
