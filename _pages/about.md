Technologies are increasingly socially embedded: they augmenting objects in our physical environment, facilitate our social interactions, and even transform the ways we process information and manage our behavior.

Ubiquitous computing systems and devices influence how we live, what we value, and how we relate to others. My research seeks to understand how diverse human values are entangled in the design and use of these technologies that shape our way of life.

Recent projects explore collective remembering in families and self-tracking for health & wellness. Read more about my work under Research.
