How can we help parent’s capture memories of their young children? What do they want to capture, and how do they know if what they’ve recorded is meaningful to them?

**Methods:** Interviews, prototype design, technology probe, field study
**Collaborators:** David Merritt (PhD, UM CSE), Mark Ackerman (Advisor, UMSI/CSE, Advisor)

**Publication:** [CSCW 2017](http://dl.acm.org/authorize?N42703)

## The Design...

The KidKeeper system[^1], aka "Froggy," is a plush green frog toy who lets young children (ages 2-7) record short audio clips of themselves and play them back. Froggy also selects one audio clip daily to send to parents. A parent who is often away from home can listen in to sounds of their children playing, creating a greater awareness and connection. Parents who are home can experience “never-before-heard” moments as kids talk to their toy. Little snippets of talk from a pre-schooler can even give insight into “how their little brains work.” Families can choose to save these recordings as mementos to look back on as their kids quickly grow.

## Our motivation...

We were inspired to do this project on two levels. David’s 3 young daughters were growing up quick, and he loved the idea of recording their voices for the future. Jasmine was developing interactive technologies for families to help them create and share audio-recorded mementos of the past. We wanted to dig deeper into parents' impulses to save everything about their kids as memories for the future. We also wanted to use audio because other researchers have found that audio recordings of children’s voices are incredibly important to parents, like “sonic gems.”[^2] So, David built the KidKeeper system, and Jasmine designed a study to ask, “What are parents trying to save about their kids?”

## What we learned...

KidKeeper was a fun toy for kids to play with. We also learned a lot about what it means to parents to capture a memory vs. just recording content. Before the study, they had no idea what they might want to hear from their kids or what they might like. After a week of listening to an eclectic assortment of audio recordings, parents said that some recordings were “cute,” “amusing,” or “surprising,” while others were “just noise.” Importantly, parents were then able to articulate that <span style="color:teal">_what they really wanted were recordings that captured a sense of their child’s personality._</span>

We found three ways that personality factored into value judgements:

1. **Quality:** Even “bad" clips could have value. What might sound like noise or randomly shouted words to one person could be incredibly meaningful to a parent as “just how [my kids] sound.”

2. **Representativeness:** All of our families had multiple children, however, some kids were less verbose. Some kids made recordings that were more likely to be filtered out by our sorting mechanism. Parents were disappointed to hear less from some of their children over the week.

3. **Meaningfulness:** This seemed to be a combination of familiarity and discovery. Parents definitely wanted to preserve familiar and more typical sounds their children recorded. They also wanted to save “surprising” or “first-time” moments, too.

What we didn't find:

After a week of unrestricted use, parents did not mention concerns about privacy with this toy. Given the pushback at the time with HelloBarbie (a toy with conversational agent toy that recorded children's conversations), this surprised us. We made a number of design decisions to try to proactively ease privacy concerns, and the lack of concern suggest to us that these design features worked.



This work helps to articulate values-in-design for families who use technology to capture and preserve precious memories of their everyday life.
